## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Errors Not Appearing?

**Check 1:** Is DSN configured?
```javascript
// In browser console
import { isSentryInitialized } from './js/utils/sentry-config.js';
isSentryInitialized();  // Should return true
```

**Check 2:** Are you in production?
```javascript
// In browser console
window.location.hostname;  // Should NOT be 'localhost'
```

**Check 3:** Check console for errors
```
[Sentry] ✅ Initialized successfully  ← Good
[Sentry] DSN not configured  ← Problem
```

### Can't Find Error in Dashboard?

1. Check timestamp - maybe it's in past days
2. Filter by environment - check "production" vs "development"
3. Check Sentry notifications - maybe alert hasn't fired yet
4. Refresh dashboard (Ctrl+R)
5. Check DSN is correct
